I am a passionate engineer dedicated to solving real-world problems through intelligent systems.

With a deep focus on **Computer Vision** and **NLP**, I have helped startups and enterprises automate complex workflows and uncover hidden value in their data lakes.

I am fluent in Python, PyTorch, and the modern MLOps stack (Docker, K8s, Terraform). When I'm not coding, I'm writing about system design for AI.

## My Journey

My journey in data science began during my undergraduate years when I first discovered the power of machine learning to solve complex problems. What started as curiosity quickly turned into a passion for building end-to-end systems that deliver real business value.

## What I Do

- **Machine Learning Engineering**: Building and deploying production-grade ML models
- **Data Pipeline Architecture**: Designing scalable data processing systems
- **Technical Leadership**: Mentoring teams and driving best practices

## Beyond Work

When I'm not immersed in data and code, you'll find me exploring the latest research papers, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge through blog posts and talks.
