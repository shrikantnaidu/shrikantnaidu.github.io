I work at the intersection of data, engineering, and decision-making. Most of my work revolves around designing intelligent systems that don’t just look good in theory, but hold up in production

I specialize in building **Scalable Data Systems** and **Production-Grade ML Pipelines**, helping startups and enterprises automate complex workflows and uncover hidden value in their data lakes.

I am fluent in Python, PyTorch, and the modern MLOps stack (Docker, K8s, Terraform). When I'm not coding, I'm learning about system design for production AI.

## My Journey

I got into data science during my undergraduate years, driven less by algorithms and more by the idea that software could make sense of messy reality. 

Over time, that curiosity hardened into an obsession with end-to-end ownership not just models, but pipelines, infra, and the decisions they enable.

I’ve learned that most real problems aren’t ML problems, they’re system problems.

## What I Do

- **Machine Learning Engineering**: Building and running ML systems that survive real usage, not just notebooks.
- **Data Pipeline Architecture**: Designing scalable data pipelines and internal platforms that teams can build on.
- **Technical Leadership**: Driving execution, mentoring engineers, and keeping teams focused on outcomes over novelty.

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, I spend time reading research, systems, philosophy, and writing to clarify my own thinking. 

I’m less interested in trends, more in ideas that compound over time - doing the boring things with discipline over chasing directionless innovation.

When I step away from work, I unwind by watching my favorite team dominate La Liga with beautiful football, or by taking out competitive energy on friends over a game of Counter-Strike.
