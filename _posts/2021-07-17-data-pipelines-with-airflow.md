### Project Overview

Sparkify, a music streaming startup, has a growing need to manage and analyze vast amounts of user activity data. To facilitate this, the analytics team requires a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that can efficiently process and load data into a data lake. This project leverages Apache Airflow to orchestrate the ETL workflow, ensuring that data is consistently and reliably processed.

The challenge lies in automating the data pipeline to handle various data sources, transformations, and loading processes while maintaining data integrity and performance.

### Technical Architecture

The architecture of the data pipeline is designed to ensure data quality and efficient processing. The source datasets consist of JSON logs detailing user activity and song metadata. The project includes the following key components:

#### Database Schema

• **Staging Tables**
- • `staging_events`: Temporary storage for event data.
- • `staging_songs`: Temporary storage for song data.

• **Fact Table**
- • `songplays`: Records of song plays, capturing user interactions.

• **Dimension Tables**
- • `users`: Information about users.
- • `songs`: Metadata about songs.
- • `artists`: Information about artists.
- • `time`: Timestamps broken down into specific units.


#### Project Structure

The project is organized into several key files:

- a. **dags/udac_example_dag.py**: Defines the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for scheduling tasks and managing dependencies.
- b. **plugins/operators/**: Contains custom operator plugins used in the DAG.
- c. **stage_redshift.py**: Stages data from S3 to Redshift.
- d. **load_fact.py**: Loads data into the fact table in Redshift.
- e. **load_dimension.py**: Loads data into dimension tables in Redshift.
- f. **data_quality.py**: Performs data quality checks on Redshift tables.
- g. **plugins/helpers/**: Helper modules for the plugins.
- h. **README.md**: Documentation detailing the execution process and project setup.

### Key Features

a. **Dynamic Pipelines**: Built from reusable tasks, allowing for easy modifications and scalability.
b. **Monitoring**: Integrated monitoring capabilities to track the status of ETL processes.
c. **Data Quality Checks**: Ensures the integrity of data after ETL steps, catching discrepancies early.

### Conclusion

This project exemplifies the power of Apache Airflow in automating and managing ETL processes for data warehouses. By implementing a robust data pipeline, Sparkify can efficiently process and analyze user activity data, leading to valuable insights into user behavior and song preferences.
